# FLOOF January Recap

## 2026 Opening Social/Semester Kickoff

<img src="/assets/images/2026.02.Newsletter/opening_social_2026S.jpg">

Our Opening Social was a resounding success! We appreciate each and every one of you who showed up to our start of semester event!

This has broken the record of our most registered/attended event, with 80 registrations and 68 check ins, beating our previous record of 76 registrations and 67 (don't say it) check ins, held by last semester's Opening Social!

At this event, our Eboard and Committees were introduced, and we went over our planned events this semester! We then had a FLOOF Kahoot (courtesy of Miguel) with awesome posters as the prizes! Afterwards, everyone was welcome to socialize, with complementary pizza from our dearest Treasurer Alief! Special thanks to our Social Media Manager Miguel for making and organizing the presentation!

## Student Organization Fair

Come say hi to us at USF's Student Organization Fair, 7:00pm - 9:00pm February 4th! At this event, the braver part of our Eboard (not me) will be putting us out there, showing off our fabulous club those unfortunate enough to be unaware of our on-campus presence!

Of course, if you're reading this newsletter, you should have some idea of what FLOOF is already (I hope)

## Feed-A-Bull Donation Drive

Student Government is hosting a donation drive for Feed-A-Bull, USF's food pantry. From now until Friday, February 13th we can donate items to Feed-A-Bull as an organization through drop-off locations in the MSC Atrium and the SG Suite in MSC 4300. This is a great opportunity for FLOOF to be more involved with giving back to the community, and to provide Feed-A-Bull with much needed support.

SG is also offering free catering up to $250 for the organization that donates the most to the food drive. **Make sure that any donations you make are labeled with a sticky note on each item so that they count for FLOOF.**

High demand items:

• Canned Chicken
• Canned tuna
• Canned fruit
• Cereal
• Pasta
• Pasta Sauce
• Peanut Butter
• Rice


<cite>"Donations can be dropped off in the  MSC Atrium or the SG Suite in MSC 4300  (4th floor of Student Life Tower). For questions or concerns, please reach out to Caitlyn Campbell (ccampbell24@usf.edu)."</cite>

-- USF Student Government

<cite>As someone who has gotten things from Feed-A-Bull many times, its a service that really helps USF students out and is 100% worth donating to. Catering prize aside, I want to see us make an impact for our USF community.</cite>
