> FLOOF is for USF Students and Alumni who are interested in Furries, Furry Culture, or are interested in learning more about Furries. By encouraging self-expression and creativity, we are creating a space for art, culture, and friendship to thrive for students with a common interest in Furries. Additionally, we aim to foster a community that is not only supportive of Furries but also supportive of the LGBTQ+ community at USF and beyond.
